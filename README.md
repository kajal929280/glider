# glider
A glider is an aircraft designed to fly without an engine, relying on aerodynamic lift and external forces like air currents to stay aloft. Unlike powered aircraft, gliders gain initial altitude through launching methods such as aerotowing, winch launching, or being released from a high-altitude point, and then glide using natural air currents.
